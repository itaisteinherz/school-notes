### Class work

#### Brainstorming

<u>Waverly</u> - Waverly is a smart but hurt girl. She is very intelligent considering her age, and she is trying to show it in different ways. Yet, Waverly is always trying to please her mother, who is never satisfied with anything she does. As a result, Waverly is very vulnerable to her mother and never sees herself as a success.

<u>Waverly's mother</u> - Waverly's mother is an immigrant from China. She is full of wisdom, and she's trying to pass that on to her children. To help Waverly succeed, her mother pushes her to practice the "art of invisible strengths", be a proper Chinese woman, and excel at everything she does. She conceals herself inside a shell of anger, toughness and rigidity, and she never shows her feelings to anyone. As a result, she has a hard time communicating with others and her family, which hurts her even further.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I am Waverly.                                                | We are mother and daughter.                                  | I am Waverly's mother.                                       |
| I think that my mother is never satisfied with anything I do. | We are in disagreement about how Waverly should behave and live. | I think Waverly isn't motivated, and doesn't do her best on everything she does. |
| I hope mother will understand that I'm always trying to make her happy, and will be pleased with my achievements. | -                                                            | I hope Waverly will become successful and listen to my advice for once. |
| I like learning new things and playing around.               | We both appreciate education and pursue it.                  | I like educating my children and best quality things.        |
| I was born in the US and raised as an American Chinese.      | We grew up in different places and environments, and as a result behave and act differently. | I was born in China and raised as traditional Chinese.       |
| I always give my best in everything I do.                    | We both strive to excel at everything we do.                 | I try to please my parents and do everything the best I can. |
